# tensorflow-basics
I am making these Jupyter notebooks , with bunch of comments and markdown cells, during my learning and studying of Tensorflow (API by Google). These notebooks are a clubbed result of various sources that teaches TensorFlow.
And hence can be used by anyone interested in learning Tensorflow for various uses.
